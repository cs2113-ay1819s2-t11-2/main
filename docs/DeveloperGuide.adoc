== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

* JDK 9 or later
* IntelliJ IDE

=== Importing the project into IntelliJ

. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. If JDK 9 is listed in the drop down, select it. If it is not, click `New...` and select the directory where you installed JDK 9
.. Click `OK`
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Run the `seedu.addressbook.Main` class (right-click the `Main` class and click `Run Main.main()`) and try executing a few commands
. Run all the tests (right-click the `test` folder, and click `Run 'All Tests'`) and ensure that they pass
. Open the `StorageFile` file and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=java.xml.bind' to module compiler options`

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Sort feature
==== Current Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by `UniquePersonList`. It stores a list of all persons in the address book as an `internalList`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `UniquePersonList#SortByName()` -- Sort `internalList` by name column in alphabetical order
* `UniquePersonList#SortByAppointment()` -- Sort `internalList` by appointment column in alphabetical order
* `UniquePersonList#SortByStatus()` -- Sort `internalList` by status column in alphabetical order

These operations are exposed in `AddressBook` as `AddressBook#sorted(String attribute)`. Corresponding operation will be called depending on attribute the user wants to sort the list by.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `UniquePersonList` will be initialized with the initial address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `add n/…` to add some new people. These people will be added sequentially to the end of the list.

Step 3. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as list, will usually not call `AddressBook#sorted(String attribute)` . Thus, the `internalList` remains unchanged.

Step 4. The user decides to view the list sorted by their name by executing the `sort name` command. This command will call `AddressBook#sorted(String attribute)` and pass the string “name” to the method. Since the value of parameter is “name”, `SortByName()` will be called. `internalList` will then be sorted by name column in alphabetical order. At last, `internalList` will be returned and displayed to the user.

=== Refer feature
==== Current Implementation

The refer feature is still currently undergoing development. In version 1.2, it takes on the architure of the find command - looks through the list of persons in addressbook and prints out those with keywords in their names. The difference is that if there is only 1 person, his particulars will not be printed - a simulation that he/ she is going to be tagged in a separate list after being removed from the address book.

=== Login/Register/Logout Feature 
==== Current Implementation

The login / register mechanism is facilitated by `AccountManager`, it implements the following operations:

* `AccountManager()` -- The constructor for the class `AccountManager`.
* `loadAccounts` -- Loads all the account information from local storage.
* `storeAccounts` -- Stores all the account information to local storage.
* `getLoginStatus()` -- Returns the login status to the caller.
* `setLoginStatus(boolean)` -- Sets the login status according to the parameter.
* `accountCommandHandler(String)` -- Handles the user input, checks if there is a match for username and password match if the user's command is `login`, trys to regster a new account if the user's command is `register`, returns a string to indicate the outcome.
* `register(String, String)` -- Creates a new account for user.
* `logout` --  Logs the user out of the system


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the login/register/logout mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `AccountManager` will be initialized, `loadAccounts` will be called to load all the accounts to a `HashMap` from local storage, the `HashMap` is used to keep track of all the account information.

Step2. The user executes `register Doe 123` command to register a new account with username Doe and password 123. The new username and the corresponding password will be temporarily put into the `HashMap`.

Step3. The user executes `login Doe 123` command to login to the system, if the login is successful, `setLoginStatus` will be called to set the login status accordingly, and the user will then be able to start using the addressbook.

Step4. The user executes some other commands.

Step5. The user executes `logout` command, `setLoginStatus` will be called to set the login status accordingly, and the user will be directed back to the login page.

Step6. The user terminates the program, `storeAccounts` will be called to store all the account information in the HashMap to the local storage.

The following sequence diagram shows how the login/register/logout mechanism works:

The following activity diagram explains the behaviour of the system during the execution of login/register/logout command.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to keep account information during runtime

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a HashMap to keep the username password pairs.
** Pros: Higher performance, O(1) for most of the operations.
** Cons: Larger memory overhead.
* ** Alternative 2:** Use a TreeMap to keep the username password pairs. 
** Pros: Lower performance, O(log(n)) for most of the operations.
** Cons: Less memory overhead.

HashMap is used because memory is not a serious issue for this program as the program is not memory consuming in nature.
  
===== Aspect: File format to keep account information in local storage

* **Alternative 1:** Use a JSON file to store the username password pairs .
** Pros: More compatible with HashMap and have a smaller size compared with XML.
** Cons: Larger file size compared with CSV.
* ** Alternative 2:** Use a CSV file to store the username password pairs.
** Pros: Smallest in file size.
** Cons: complicated to convert to/from HashMap. 
* ** Alternative 2:** Use a XML file to store the username password pairs
** Pros: More compatible with HashMap. 
** Cons: Largest in file size.
